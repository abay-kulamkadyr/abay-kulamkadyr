## üå± About Me

I‚Äôm a Java Developement Trainee at EPAM Systems. My passion lies in continuous learning, exploring everything from systems programming to low-level hardware and parallel computing. I thrive on solving complex challenges‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs improving user experience or optimizing embedded devices.

## üöÄ Key Projects

### Embedded Music Player
- **Overview**: Built a compact music player running on minimal hardware resources.  
- **Focus**: Low-level driver integration, efficient use of memory, and real-time audio streaming.  
- **Highlights**: Gained hands-on experience in **C/C++**, audio processing, and embedded Linux environments.  
- [GitHub: View Project](https://github.com/abay-kulamkadyr/embedded_system_audio_player)

### Improved CBS Multi-Agent Path Finding
- **Overview**: Implemented an enhanced version of the Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding.  
- **Focus**: Efficiently computing collision-free paths for multiple agents in a shared environment.  
- **Highlights**: 
  - Introduced optimizations to reduce computational overhead and improve scalability.
  - Demonstrated advanced **path planning** and **collision avoidance** techniques suitable for robotics or simulation contexts.
  - Strengthened understanding of **search algorithms**, **heuristics**, and distributed decision-making.
